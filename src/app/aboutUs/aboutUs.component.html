Gurukulam Foundation is a Registered Public Charitable Trust dedicated to promote and preserve our rich Indian Classical Music and Fine Arts. Music is the integral part of our culture which has been transmitted by our forefathers to the progeny for their ultimate happiness. On the road from barbarism to culture, music has been the biggest stepping stone for human beings. Indian classical music is highly sophisticated, extremely penetrating and divine in nature. Lord Krishna was deeply enchanted by music; Lord Brahma is also engrossed in it and the instrument of Veena is synonymous with Goddess Saraswati. To make our heritage and treasured music come alive and make it popular to the masses, Gurukulam Foundation is established with the noble object of service to humanity and thus making immense contribution in the field of Music. For proper enunciation and spread of music, Gurukulam Foundation strives hard to enthuse younger generation to appreciate the greatness of Indian Classical Music by giving them an opportunity to learn from experts in this field.

Gurukulam Foundation is also in the process of assimilitating information with the hope to improve and bring to the Countryâ€™s Capital, the kind of music and Artistes one appreciates.
